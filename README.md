# The second task AQAlab

This is a repository for storing the second practical task Python AQA Lab.

The  directory 'tests' contains tests for the first task JobParser and the directory 'tests with selenium'.

In this model, I tried to implement the PageObject pattern.

'Tests with selenium' directory contains test files, configuration file for the tests and 'pages' directory.

The 'pages' directory contains page model files for testing. Each module describes the methods that I use during testing.
File locators.py contains some special locators for different elements on pages.
